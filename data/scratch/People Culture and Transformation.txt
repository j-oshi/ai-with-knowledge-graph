## Hi!

## I am delighted that you're interested in this exciting new opportunity to join The Children's Society.

Every child should be able to grow up safe, happy, and hopeful. It is a scandal that today millions of children in this country live in poverty, struggle with mental health issues, are groomed into exploitation, and are abused. The Children's Society has a bold and audacious vision for a society built for all children: one where every child can grow up filled with hope for the future.

For more than a decade, The Children's Society's Good Childhood Report has shown that young people's wellbeing in the UK is getting worse. Despite an ever-growing list of threats to the safety of teenagers, their needs are being ignored. And a severe lack of support means that those most at risk are not receiving help until they've reached crisis point.

This is unacceptable. Every child should be able to look forward to their future with hope. That's why we at The Children's Society have set an ambitious goal: by 2030 we will have overturned this damaging decline in children's wellbeing and set a path for long-lasting growth. This goal informs every choice and decision we make as an organisation. By joining forces with teenagers, our supporters, and our partners, we can make sure positive change is happening in the right places and at the right times. Teenagers are still children, and a future of hope and happiness belongs to every one of them.

To reach our goal, we need a brilliant, committed, energetic team that's backed up by a movement of thousands of people who choose to stand with us and support us with their time, their money, and their voice.

If you share this vision and are excited to do the best work of your life for this incredible organisation, you'll fit in well at The Children's Society. We'd love to hear from you. We're so proud of all that TeamTCS is achieving but we are impatient. Children can't wait any longer for change.

## Come and join us!

## Introduction to the People, Culture, and Transformation domain

Hello. My name is Michelle and I lead the People, Culture, and Transformation domain here at The Children's Society. Newly formed in 2024, People, Culture, and Transformation is passionate about being a trusted strategic function, providing excellent service and ensuring that we are respected as leaders inside and outside the organisation.

<!-- image -->

A significant part of the Enabling domain, we bring together our knowledge, skills, and experience to ensure that The Children's Society is enabled with organisation design, skills, and capability to achieve growth in income and impact and deliver our all-important goal.

We provide a human-centred approach to human resources and a digital-first experience to all things tech, data, and digital.

I believe it's vital that together we create the right conditions for people to feel valued, thrive, and be happy in their work and when volunteering. This means creating the right conditions for people experience, ensuring that equity, diversity, and inclusion are woven throughout all that we do. When it comes to our digital transformation, applying the same experience philosophy and a truly enabling environment is crucial. It's important to me that every single person understands how they contribute to this within People, Culture, and Transformation and feels the value they are adding to people experience.

We work hard to build on the strong foundations we have laid with our people experience framework through getting the basics right, inspiring leadership, having a voice , and feeling valued . We are determined to ensure we continuously improve what we do so that The Children's Society continues to grow, deliver our goal and, most of all, create positive change and impact with the children and young people we support.

## Our work

Across the country, young people are suffering unseen and unheard. They're facing overwhelming challenges - struggling with their mental health, living in poverty, and in danger from exploitation and abuse.

Too often, teenagers in particular are missing out on the support they need. Teenagers are still children, and a future of hope and happiness belongs to every one of them.

At The Children's Society, we know that this brighter future is possible. That's why we've been working for more than 140 years to build the society young people need. Our services support thousands of children every year, and our campaigning impacts the lives of many thousands more.

Every day, we see the incredible difference the right support can make. We're hugely proud of all that TeamTCS achieves year-on-year and of the incredible young people we work with.

## Daniel's story

Growing up, Daniel had always been happy enough. He was doing well at school, and he enjoyed hanging out with his friends. But when he was a teenager, his mental health began to spiral. He didn't know how to cope. He started taking drugs to try to numb the pain he was feeling. His dad, Sam, felt powerless as he watched his son become more and more unhappy. Feeling utterly shattered and broken down, Daniel took two overdoses in the space of a week and was hospitalised.

That's when Sam reached out to The Children's Society. When Daniel came home from hospital, he met with one of our specialist practitioners, Steve. At weekly sessions, Steve worked with Sam and Daniel to give them a framework to navigate what had happened and begin to heal. Because Daniel loved martial arts and yoga, Steve focused the sessions on learning about meditation and yoga, helping Daniel find new ways to cope. Sam joined a family support group, too.

For Daniel, getting the right support was transformational. Now, he and his dad are looking forward to the future with hope. Because we take a holistic, child-centred approach, we were able to support Daniel in a way that was tailored to his needs - making the help he received more effective.
